# Better Error Pages

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kodgemisi/better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kodgemisi/better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter)

This is a `Spring Boot Starter` project which provides Rails like error pages for Spring Boot applications for development environments.

For **rest requests**, any error is archived until a configurable `timeout` and the error page url is sent in rest request's response headers.

## Demo

https://better-error-pages-demo.herokuapp.com

Note that demo page is a Heroku app so it may be sleeping when you first open the page, it may take 1-2 min for server to wake up.

## Quick Start

Just add the dependency to your maven/gradle of your Spring Boot application then it will autoconfigure itself and
_Better Error Pages_ will be available if your active profiles includes `dev` or `development`.

**Adding the dependency to your project**

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.kodgemisi</groupId>
    <artifactId>better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

See https://jitpack.io/#kodgemisi/better-error-pages-spring-boot-starter for Jitpack usage, dependency details, version info and Gradle usage.

## Configuration

Better Error Pages;

* sets `server.error.include-stacktrace: always` and `server.error.include-exception: true` automatically.
* autoconfigures itself if active profile has `dev` or `development` however you can override this via `better-error-pages.profiles` property.
* finds your `@SpringBootApplication` annotated class and use its package name as `better-error-pages.package-name` name however you can override this via `better-error-pages.package-name` property.

Setting `better-error-pages.package-name` property improves startup performance significantly but won't affect runtime performance.

<span style="color: darkorange;font-weight: bold;">âš </span>
If you set `better-error-pages.package-name` property then your project must have **one of** following files:

* application.yml
* application-dev.yml
* application.properties
* application-dev.properties

<span style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">ðŸ›ˆ</span>
Note that `package-name` should be typically your own base package which is used throughout your own classes like `com.yourcompany`.

```yaml
better-error-pages:
  package-name: <String> # A package name whose classes' source code will be parsed and displayed in error pages. Mandatory.
  profiles: <String or List of string> # Override default profiles to enable Better Error Pages. Default value: "dev, development"
```

## Limitations

* Won't work for package names containing upper case characters.
* Can't show source code in multi module projects only if the project is run as packaged but other features will work.
  * When running multi module projects from an IDE everything just works.

## Troubleshooting

### IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder

`Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'better-error-pages.package-name' in value "${better-error-pages.package-name}"`

 See Prerequisites, you need to set `better-error-pages.package-name` property.
